# 🎓 Student Union Voting Platform

Welcome to the official home of our **Student Union Elections** project!  
This platform was created to make voting simple, secure, and transparent for everyone on campus.

## 🌟 What This Project Is About

- **Your voice matters**: Every student gets a unique code to cast their vote.
- **Fairness first**: Votes are anonymous and counted with care.
- **Clear timelines**: Countdown clocks show when voting starts, when it closes, and when results will be announced.
- **Trustworthy results**: Winners are revealed only after the official announcement time, so everyone sees the same information at the same moment.

## 🗳️ How It Works

1. **Get Your Code**  
   Pick up your secure voting voucher from the student union office.

2. **Cast Your Vote**  
   Log in with your code, choose your candidates, and submit your ballot.

3. **Verify Your Impact**  
   After voting, you’ll receive a receipt code. Use it later to confirm your vote was counted.

4. **Wait for Results**  
   Once voting ends, the system shows a countdown to the official announcement.  
   No early reveals — everyone sees the results together.
